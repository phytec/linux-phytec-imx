title: TI DS90UB954 FPD-Link III Deserializer

maintainers:
  - Stefan Riedmueller <s.riedmueller@phytec.de>

description: |
  The DS90UB954 Deserializer features two Flat Panel Display (FPD) Link III
  connection inputs and one MIPI-CSI2 output. The D-PHY on the MIPI-CSI2
  output supports up to 4 lanes.
  The DS90UB954 works in combination with a DS90UB953 FPD Link III serializer.

  The FPD Link III link also encapsulates bidirectional I2C messages between
  the I2C busses connected to the serializers and deserializer. To prevent I2C
  address collisions between devices connected to the serializers only I2C
  messages are forwarded to the serializers which addresses have been
  configured in the deserializer. There is also a mechanism to use aliases for
  devices with the same address on each serializer but this is currently not
  supported.

  Currently only one port can be active and used at a time which is selected
  by media control link status.

      The video connections between sources and sink via the
      serializer/deserializer combination are modelled using the OF graph
      bindings in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

      The following table lists the port number corresponding to each device
      port.
